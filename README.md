## Theoretical Background

Rectangular waveguides are ideal for high-frequency applications due to their low-loss and high-power handling capabilities. The dominant TE<sub>10</sub> mode is critical for energy propagation, while parameters like cutoff frequency and modal distribution are essential for ensuring operational efficiency in satellite communications. Detailed theoretical insights can be found in the [Design Specifications Documentation](docs/design_specifications.md).
